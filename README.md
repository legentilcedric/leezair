Leezair application

The code is not resistant to any other character than 'a' to 'z' and ' '.
The actual number of senetences is not compared to the number read on the first line, possible array out of bounds error

Possible improvements :
    - Add input format check
    - Set the text to test as an argument of pangram.py and not as a fixed argument of the fonction
    - Stop the presence check as soon as all the characters are detected (more efficient for long sentences)
